# New Orleans Flood Mapping Project (Post Hurricane Data Analysis)
This group project examines hurricane flooding in New Orleans, a city vulnerable due to its low topography and proximity to the Gulf of Mexico. By using cartographic skills, we aimed to help residents, emergency responders, and policymakers better prepare for and mitigate future hurricane damage, though it is crucial to emphasize investing in high-risk zones to prevent exacerbating socio-economic disparities.

## Introduction

For our project we will examine hurricane flooding in New Orleans. New Orleans is located just off of the Gulf of Mexico, a tropical storm generating body of water. Due to New Orleans location, and its general topography being relatively low with some areas below sea level, it is very vulnerable to hurricanes. In 2005, the city was hit by Hurricane Katrina, (facts here, discuss displacement and destruction). With the onset of global warming causing more extreme weather events around the world, it becomes increasingly important to equip cities like New Orleans with tools to mitigate and respond to these natural disasters which may become more frequent and intense with time. Using our skills as cartographers, we aim to examine the city and the risk posed by future hurricanes to provide a tool for potential damage mitigation and emergency response development.

The intended audience of the project are residents of the area, and also any emergency responding groups. City and state offices and policy-makers are likewise an important audience as a powerful agent in enacting fiscally sourced change such as infrastructure development.

Positive impacts of the project are better preparing residents of New Orleans for future hurricanes, as well as giving policy-makers and emergency responders better tools to understand the nature of hurricanes and flooding in New Orleans to better protect the population and reduce damage and risk to public safety. Impacts could also include the development of new infrastructure to better aid in emergency situations. Negative impacts could include policy-makers choosing to invest less in zones deemed at high risk for flooding, which could worsen socio-economic disparities in the city and put lives at greater risk. We could attempt to avoid this by emphasizing the need to invest in higher risk zones to bring down overall risk in the city.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Visual Studio, GitHub, Mapbox, Figma

We first drafted an outline of what we wanted to talk about, that thing was the Flood Risk in New Orleans. With the onset of global warming causing more extreme weather events around the world, it becomes increasingly important to equip cities like New Orleans with tools to mitigate and respond to these natural disasters which may become more frequent and intense with time. Using our skills as cartographers, we aim to examine the city and the risk posed by future hurricanes to provide a tool for potential damage mitigation and emergency response development. We then looked up crucial sources to corroborate our claim and come up with plans to help policy-makers to come up with preventative measures and invest in zones that will help reduce flooding. The sources we used were NOLA hurricane water level increase and flood data for developing risk zone levels, SRTM elevation for use i applying flood risk zones to New Orleans (assets), New Orleans lot data for development of flood risk map from the New Orleans Open Data, NOLA population by block group for population analysis, Income dataset for the census tracts, NOLA ready about the hazards and coastal erosion, failure of levees whch are walls aritficial or natural that block out water, New Orleans Floodwalls, New Orleans Histry, New Orleans Topography, and also

## Optimizations

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
